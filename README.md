### Recommended:
1. If you wish to upload your versions of the jupyter notebooks for visualization or analysis of transaction data, please removing sensitive outputs before you push. I do this using tools that can be found [here](https://github.com/ShekharNarayanan/everyday_tools/tree/main/jupyter).
